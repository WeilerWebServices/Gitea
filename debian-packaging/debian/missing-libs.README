Contrib Reasoning
-----------------

The libraries included here are required for gitea to function
but not currently distributed in Debian.

- Vue.js: https://bugs.debian.org/871459

Non-free Reasoning
------------------

The volume of dependencies is too much for a single person to handle. The packages
that once existed have mostly been removed from Debian due to auto-QA processes.

This packaging now utilizes what's included in vendor directories which means
DFSG-freeness cannot be assured, despite attempts to remove problematic sources.

Notes
-----

See rev:981ac0a for a version of packaging suitable for Debian main.
